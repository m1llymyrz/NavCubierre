# NavCubierre
Final Project for University of Wyoming's Mathematical Computational Physics 2 course

# Introduction
NavCubierre is a theoretical navigation software meant for interstellar warp drives, such as an Alcubierre drive, which NavCubierre was named after. This navigation system provides users with an optimized travel time flightplan or optimized fuel flightplan when travelling between stars. 
There were a few key assumptions made with this project that impact the real-world application of this navigation system. That being said, Alcubierre drives are pureley theoretical themselves and break the laws of physics. NavCubierre ignores relativity and displays travel times in proper time, rather than in dilated time. This assumption was made due to the nature of the Alcubierre drive. 

## Relativity and assumtions
Alcubierre drives work by creating a "space-time bubble" around the spacecraft. This bubble warps the fabric of space-time in front of the ship down, and warps the space-time fabric behind the ship up. This method makes a "space-time wave" that the ship can ride on, and allows the ship to travel faster than the speed of light. 
Typically when objects move at relativistic speeds (i.e. at or near the speed of light), time is dilated. Time moves slower for people moving at a relativistic speed, rather than for someone not moving at a relativistic speed. Since NavCubierre shows users a time optimized path, dilated time was neglected for this travel time.
